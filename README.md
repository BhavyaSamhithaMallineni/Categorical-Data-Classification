# Laptop Price Prediction Project

## Overview
The "Laptop Price Prediction" project, conducted as part of EE 559 at the University of Southern California, aims to leverage various machine learning models to predict laptop prices. The dataset used comprises 1,300 entries, with features detailed across 11 columns.

## Project Files
- **EE_559_Course_Project_Code_Mallinen.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of three machine learning models: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and a Neural Network.
- **EE_559_Final_Project_Report_Mallinen.pdf**: A detailed report explaining the methodology, process, and results of the predictive analysis.

## Models Used
1. **Linear Regression**: Applied using Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse and gradient descent methods.
2. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Utilizes an RBF kernel to manage non-linear relationships among data points.
3. **Neural Network**: Consists of a single-layer architecture, which learns patterns from the data.

## Libraries
This project utilizes Python and several of its libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn`
These libraries help in data preprocessing, model construction, and performance evaluation.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models was evaluated using the following metrics:
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)

## Results
SVR showed the best performance across all metrics, proving effective in capturing complex data patterns and providing accurate predictions.

## How to Run the Project
1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.
